in concurrent queue the 3 progressview started in FIFO(first in first out) order where task 1 starts then task 2 and at last task 3 but here the The exact number of tasks that can be executed at any given instance is variable and is dependent on the system's current conditions and resources. 
The decision on when to start a task is up to GCD
